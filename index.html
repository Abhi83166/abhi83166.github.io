        <h2>üìú Manifesto</h2>
        <p>
          Science improves our lives. Science is a provisional explanation of the world; it consists of intriguing questions and speculative answers to them. However, at some point, we gave little care to our inventions and never considered the future. In 1972, MIT researchers predicted the collapse of society. By 2040, the drive for economic expansion, coupled with humanity's complete disdain for the environment and society, will have caused irreparable damage to the planet. We may all agree that we are on the right track, but this time we are on the right track towards the worst possible outcomes.
        </p>

        <p>
          Humanity faces a profound reality: the choices we make today will determine the narratives we tell future generations about the struggle against economic and climatic catastrophe. However, I still think that with an open and collaborative scientific approach, we can strive to rescue our society and ourselves. Our response should reflect a transformational attitude, altering all systems to be more sustainable and applying systems thinking methodologies to yield many advantages for the environment, society, and economy. Science plays a significant role by giving people the facts they need to comprehend the implications of many decisions and the possibility to build a future that enhances the lives of all people.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am acquiring knowledge and will continue to do so in order to generate ideas that might help to develop a more sustainable world.
