					<h1 class="pa-h1-v3 pa-bright fadeInDelay03Duration10"><strong>MANIFESTO</strong></h1>
					<p class="pa-p-v1 pa-bright fadeInDelay03Duration10">Science improves our lives. Science is a provisional explanation of the world; it consists of intriguing questions and speculative answers to them. However, at some point, we gave little care to our inventions and never considered the future. In 1972, MIT researchers predicted the collapse of society. By 2040, the drive for economic expansion, coupled with humanity's complete disdain for the environment and society, will have caused irreparable damage to the planet. We may all agree that we are on the right track, but this time we are on the right track towards the worst possible outcomes.

					<br><br>	Humanity faces a profound reality: the choices we make today will determine the narratives we tell future generations about the struggle against economic and climatic catastrophe. However, I still think that with an open and collaborative scientific approach, we can strive to rescue our society and ourselves. Our response should reflect a transformational attitude, altering all systems to be more sustainable and applying systems thinking methodologies to yield many advantages for the environment, society, and economy. Science plays a significant role by giving people the facts they need to comprehend the implications of many decisions and the possibility to build a future that enhances the lives of all people.
						
					<br><br>	I am acquiring knowledge and will continue to do so in order to generate ideas that might help to develop a more sustainable world.</p>

					<h1 class="pa-h1-v3 pa-bright fadeInDelay03Duration10"><strong>ABOUT ME</strong></h1>
					<p class="pa-p-v1 pa-bright fadeInDelay03Duration10">As a polymath by nature and an engineer by profession, I believe that the pursuit of knowledge is a lifelong journey that requires an interdisciplinary approach. My experience in mechatronics and computer engineering has given me a solid foundation in technical skills, but my passion for learning extends beyond the boundaries of these fields. I find myself drawn to the study of science, philosophy, psychology, and history, constantly seeking to broaden my horizons and deepen my understanding of the world we live in.

					<br><br>	My aim and vision is to create a sustainable and advanced future for all, and I believe that the key to achieving this lies in working towards the 17 Global Goals for Sustainable Development. I am deeply committed to using my skills and expertise to contribute towards these goals, and have worked on a range of projects spanning areas such as AI, IoT, robotics, AR/VR, software development, and cybersecurity.
						
					<br><br>	To me, the pursuit of sustainability and innovation is not just a matter of technical expertise, but a deeply philosophical and ethical pursuit. I believe that our choices and actions today will shape the future of our world, and that we have a moral responsibility to use our knowledge and skills for the greater good. As an engineer and a learner, I am constantly striving to find new ways to bridge the gap between technology and humanity, and to create a future where humans and AI can coexist harmoniously, in a world that is equitable, just, and sustainable for all.

				  <span>NOVEL AUTOMATIC WASTE DISPENSER.</span>
				  <span class="symbol">+</span>
				</div>
				<div class="project-summary">
				  <p>Do you hate wasting ketchup or other sauces from your favorite food bottle? You're not alone. Millions of tons of sauce go to waste every year, just because it's difficult to get the last few drops out of the bottle. That's why I designed and developed a zero waste dispenser that gets out more than 99% of the content. My dispenser features a novel linear-to-rotary mechanism that allows sauce to flow out based on the user's tilt, eliminating waste and keeping your food tasting great..</p>

				  <span>AI BASED HYDROPONICS SYSTEM.</span>
				  <span class="symbol">+</span>
				</div>
				<div class="project-summary">
				  <p>As the world grapples with the effects of climate change and the need for more sustainable farming practices, I wanted to design a solution that would be both efficient and effective. That's why I created an AI-based hydroponics system that maximizes productivity and minimizes the need for human intervention. My system uses advanced algorithms to predict the optimum conditions and flow of liquids required to keep your plants healthy and thriving, with over 93% accuracy. With this system, you can enjoy the benefits of hydroponic gardening without any of the hassle.</p>

				  <span>A PLANT BASED SWITCH</span>
				  <span class="symbol">+</span>
				</div>
				<div class="project-summary">
				  <p>This project explores the possibility of creating a switch using plants as the conducting material. By leveraging the electrical conductivity of the water fibers and leaves in plants, a capacitive sensing algorithm is able to detect when a leaf is touched and trigger a relay to turn on an appliance. This innovative idea not only provides a unique way to control appliances, but also promotes the use of natural and sustainable materials in technology.</p>

				  <span>AI BASED OPTICAL BACKSCATTER TURBIDITY SENSOR</span>
				  <span class="symbol">+</span>
				</div>
				<div class="project-summary">
				  <p>The Cost AI based Optical Backscatter Turbidity Sensor project aimed to address the limitations of traditional turbidity sensors which were expensive and not easily deployable. The project involved designing and developing an AI-based sensor that could accurately measure the amount of suspended sediment in real-time and with a faster sampling rate, at a cost-effective price. This was achieved by using an optical backscatter technique and integrating AI algorithms to analyze the data collected by the sensor. The sensor could be easily deployed at water shed outlets, allowing for more efficient and accurate monitoring of water quality. The Cost AI based Optical Backscatter Turbidity Sensor is a significant step forward in the field of water quality monitoring, providing a cost-effective and reliable solution for measuring suspended sediment in water bodies..</p>

				</div>
				<div class="project-summary">
				  <p>The project involves designing and developing an AI-based solar panel monitoring and forecasting system that aims to provide real-time monitoring of solar panel performance and accurately forecast future energy generation. The system uses machine learning algorithms to analyze weather data and solar panel performance data to predict energy generation and any potential issues that may arise in the future. By detecting and addressing issues early on, the system can improve the overall performance of solar panels, reduce downtime, and ultimately increase energy generation.</p>

				<div class="project-summary">
				  <p>This project aims to provide a solution to the problem of fall detection, which is a common concern for elderly people and those with medical conditions that can lead to falls. The system uses a combination of AI and IoT technologies to monitor the user's movement and detect any falls. It is designed to be wearable and unobtrusive, with sensors placed in clothing or accessories. The system also includes an alert mechanism that notifies caregivers or emergency services in case of a fall, ensuring prompt assistance for the user. The system has been tested and shown to be effective in detecting falls accurately and quickly, providing peace of mind to users and their caregivers.</p>

				  <p>The Politician Performance Index is a project aimed at providing an objective assessment of the performance of politicians. It collects data on various aspects of a politician's work, including their attendance record, voting record, engagement with constituents, and achievement of campaign promises. The data is then analyzed using machine learning algorithms to generate a performance score for each politician. The project aims to increase transparency and accountability in politics by providing voters with a clear and objective picture of their elected representatives' performance.</p>
